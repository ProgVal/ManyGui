Importing tkgui in jython gives a non-intuitive error message. It
(tkgui) should simply be ignored.

Defaults don't work properly.

Window positioning doesn't work properly in javagui and tkgui.

The cursor position and the end marker of the selection should always
be the same in tkgui. That is not currently the case.

Setting the selection of a wxgui TextField or TextArea doesn't work.

Programs running javagui don't always quit, because of some unstable
thread code (which may wait for the wrong thread).

Selecting items in a ListBox with the arrow keys in javagui doesn't
cause the callback to be activated. (Using the JListModel in a more
conventional way would help, but would cause the callback to be called
when the selection is set programmatically, which is not the desired
behaviour.)

It is impossible to select items with the arrow keys in tkgui
ListBoxes.

wxgui windows flicker excessively when resized.

All the text of a tkgui TextField or TextArea is selected when one
tabs into it. This is not consistent with wxgui and javagui, where the
selection is preserved.

The backends don't behave consistently wrt. setting or not setting
focus when the selection of a TextField or TextArea is set
programmatically.

Invisible windows crash the application when made visible in BeOS.

RadioGroups don't work properly under BeOS (but buttons on their 
own do (!) ).

Labels under BeOS display line breaks as an unprintable character: 
this is because they are designed for single line use only.

test/test_textarea.py : under BeOS, both text areas are placed in 
the same position.  I don't know if this is a textarea or place bug.

All List- and Text- Views always have scrollbars under BeOS.

The environment variables don't work as they should with jython.

When using the -D switch with jython, the values (e.g. for
ANYGUI_WISHLIST) cannot contain spaces.
