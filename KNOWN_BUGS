Importing tkgui in jython gives a non-intuitive error message. It
(tkgui) should simply be ignored.

Defaults don't work properly.

Window positioning doesn't work properly in javagui and tkgui.

Setting editable=0 makes it impossible to select/copy text in tkgui.
This should be fixed.

Setting the selection of a wxgui TextField or TextArea doesn't work.

Programs running javagui don't always quit, because of some unstable
thread code (which may wait for the wrong thread).

Selecting items in a ListBox with the arrow keys in javagui doesn't
cause the callback to be activated. (Using the JListModel in a more
conventional way would help, but would cause the callback to be called
when the selection is set programmatically, which is not the desired
behaviour.)

It is impossible to select items with the arrow keys in tkgui
ListBoxes.

wxgui windows flicker excessively when resized.

All the text of a tkgui TextField or TextArea is selected when one
tabs into it. This is not consistent with wxgui and javagui, where the
selection is preserved.

The backends don't behave consistently wrt. setting or not setting
focus when the selection of a TextField or TextArea is set
programmatically.
