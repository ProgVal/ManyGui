Goals for version 0.1:
----------------------

* Add support for the document/view model, using either
  the Observer pattern, or the signal/slot architecture

* Add basic support for defaults, including window tiling

* Add Frame class with utility factories e.g. col/row
  (May be postponed)

* Make new Windows invisible until event loop is entered
  or re-entered, e.g. after a callback

* Add basic one-level "shrink-wrapping" of windows
  (May be postponed)

Goals for version 0.2:
----------------------

* Add a dialog class

* Add support for native dialogs (e.g. file dialogs)

* Add menus

* Add full event system

* Add support for borders?

Longer term goals:
------------------

* Add advanced support for default, including default
  "shrink-wrapping" of windows and frames that aren't
  given an explicit size

* Support accessibility standards

* Add a Canvas widget for full graphics support

* Add support for importing xml files through xslt?

* Add instant model update for text widgets, not just on
  "focus lost"?

Smaller issues:
---------------

* Add proportional scaling/positioning?

* Add option objects?

* Merge .add() and .place() and allow several widgets as
  positional arguments?

* Allow multiple widges as positional arguments to place
  (instead of/in addition to sequence)
