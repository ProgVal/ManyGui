Remaining objectives for version 0.1:
-------------------------------------
Tentative release date: December 10th, 2001

* Finalise signal system/API

* Integrate the signal system into the basic callback
  mechanism

* Simplify the widget API by detaching models, using
  signals. (Also fix "value" vs "on" in ToggleButtons)

* Adjust defaults, and improve window staggering

* Add simple Frame class

* Separate layout mechanism from the Frame class (including
  the place() method), using signals

* Resolve the single-line/multi-line Label issue

* Make it possible to create widgets while the program is
  running (by improving use of ensure_created etc.)

Objectives for version 0.2:
---------------------------
Tentative release date: February 30th, 2002

* Add a dialog class

* Add support for native dialogs (e.g. file dialogs)

* Add menus (including popup menus?)

* Add full event system, based on signal()

* Add a grid-based layout mechanism
  (May require minimum_size and preferred_size properties)

* Refactor to reduce code duplication, simplify the backend
  API, and reduce coupling between core and backends

Longer term goals:
------------------

* Add advanced support for default, including default
  "shrink-wrapping" of windows and frames that aren't
  given an explicit size; will require a "preferred
  size" for all widgets, based on font sizes etc.

* Support accessibility standards

* Add a Canvas widget for full graphics support

* Add support for styled text

* Add support for importing xml files through xslt?
  (E.g. XUL)

* Add instant model update for text widgets, not just on
  "focus lost"?

* Add support for complex widgets (like wx tree widget,
  notebook, PMW-style widgets etc) with default
  implementations in the basic Anygui API (in the vein
  of the piddle/sping API)

* Make Anygui more thread-safe

Smaller issues:
---------------

* Add support for borders?

* Make new Windows invisible until event loop is entered
  or re-entered, e.g. after a callback
  (Currently works, more or less "by default", but isn't
  properly designed/implemented.)

* Add .txt endings to README etc.
