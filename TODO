* Add support for the document/view model

* Add basic support for defaults, including window tiling

* Add Frame class with utility factories e.g. col/row (?)

* Make new Windows invisible until event loop is entered
  or re-entered (after a callback)?

Longer term goals:
------------------

  "shrink-wrapping" of windows and frames that aren't
  given an explicit size

* Support accessibility standards

* Add a Canvas widget for full graphics support

* Add support for importing xml files through xslt?

* Add instant model update for text widgets, not just on
  "focus lost"?

Smaller issues:
---------------

* Add proportional scaling/positioning?

* Add option objects?

* Merge .add() and .place() and allow several widgets as
  positional arguments?
