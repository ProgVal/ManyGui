Goals for version 0.1:
----------------------

* Integrate the signal/slot architecture into the basic
  callback mechanism and document/view behaviour;
  simplify the widget API by detaching models

* Adjust defaults, and add proper window tiling

* Add Frame class with utility factories e.g. col/row,
  and/or change the standard layout mechanism to some
  form of grid(), including proportional scaling and
  positioning

* Make new Windows invisible until event loop is entered
  or re-entered, e.g. after a callback

Goals for version 0.2:
----------------------

* Add a dialog class

* Add support for native dialogs (e.g. file dialogs)

* Add menus (including popup menus?)

* Add full event system, based on signal()

* Add support for borders?

Longer term goals:
------------------

* Add advanced support for default, including default
  "shrink-wrapping" of windows and frames that aren't
  given an explicit size; will require a "preferred
  size" for all widgets, based on font sizes etc.

* Support accessibility standards

* Add a Canvas widget for full graphics support

* Add support for importing xml files through xslt?
  (E.g. XUL)

* Add instant model update for text widgets, not just on
  "focus lost"?

Smaller issues:
---------------

* Merge .add() and .place() and allow several widgets as
  positional arguments?
