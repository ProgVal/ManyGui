    <title>Contributing</title>

    <para>If you want to contribute to the <name>Anygui</name>
    project, we could certainly use your help. First of all, you
    should visit the <name>Anygui</name> web site at
    <url>http://www.anygui.org</url>, subscribe to the developer's mailing
    list (<code>devel@anygui.org</code>) and the user's list
    (<code>users@anygui.org</code>), and try to familiarise yourself
    with how the package works behind the scenes. Then, you may either
    help develop the currently supported GUI packages, or you may
    start writing a backend of your own. Several potential backend
    targets may be found at
    <url>http://starbase.neosoft.com/~claird/comp.lang.python/python_GUI.html</url>.
