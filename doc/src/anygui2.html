<h1>Anygui Manual</h1>
<div class="author">Magnus Lie Hetland</div>
<div class="date">August 2002</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The <span class="name">Python</span> standard library currently
does not contain any platform-independent GUI packages. It is the goal
of the <span class="name">Anygui</span> project to change this
situation. There are many such packages available, but none has been
defined as standard, so when writing GUI programs for <span
class="name">Python</span>, you cannot assume that your user has the
right package installed.
</p>

<p>The problem is that declaring a GUI package as standard would be
quite controversial. There are some packages that are quite commonly
available, such as Tkinter; but it would not be practical to require
all installations to include it, nor would it be desirable to require
all <span class="name">Python</span> GUI programs to use it, since
there are many programmers who prefer other packages.
</p>

<p><span class="name">Anygui</span> tries to solve this problem in a
manner similar to the standard anydbm package. There is no need to
choose one package at the expense of all others. Instead, <span
class="name">Anygui</span> gives generic access to several popular
packages through a simple API, which makes it possible to write GUI
applications that work with all these packages. Thus, one gets a
platform-independent GUI module which is written entirely in <span
class="name">Python</span>.
</p>

<p>To get the latest <span class="name">Anygui</span> distribution, or
to get in touch with the developers, please visit the <span
class="name">Anygui</span> website, at <code><a
href="http://anygui.org">anygui.org</a></code>.
</p>

<p class="note">Although the <span class="name">Anygui</span> API is
stabilising, it is not yet completely frozen.</p>

<h3>Design Goals</h3>

<ul>
<li><span class="name">Anygui</span> should be an easy to use GUI
package that may be used to create simple graphical programs, or that
may serve as the basis for more complex application frameworks.
</li>

<li><span class="name">Anygui</span> should be a pure <span
class="name">Python</span> package that serves as a front-end for as
many as possible of the GUI packages available for <span
class="name">Python</span>, in a transparent manner.
</li>

<li><span class="name">Anygui</span> should include functionality
needed to perform most GUI tasks, but should remain as simple and
basic as possible.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Structure of this Manual</h3>


<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>The <span class="name">Anygui</span> package comes in the form of a
<code>gzip</code> compressed <code>tar</code> archive, a binary
Windows installer and as an RPM package. The Windows installer and RPM
package should be fairly easy to install. To install the
<code>tar</code> archive, it you will first have to uncompress the
archive. On <span class="name">Windows</span> this can be done with
<span class="name">WinZip</span>. in <span class="name">Mac OS</span>,
you can use <span class="name">StuffIt Expander</span>. In <span
class="name">Unix</span>, first move to a directory where you'd like
to put <span class="name">Anygui</span>, and then do something like
the following:</p>

<pre>foo:~/python$ tar xzvf anygui-0.2.tar.gz</pre>

<p>If your version of tar doesn't support the <code>z</code> switch,
you can do something like this:</p>

<pre>foo:~/python$ zcat anygui-0.2.tar.gz | tar xvf</pre>

<p>Another possibility is:</p>

<pre>foo:~/python$ gunzip anygui-0.2.tar.gz
foo:~/python$ tar -xvf anygui-0.2.tar</pre>

<p>No matter which version you choose, you should end up with a
directory named <code>anygui-0.2</code>.</p>

<h3>Running setup.py</h3>

<p>The simple way of installing <span class="name">Anygui</span> is to
use the installation script that's included in the distribution. This
requires <span class="name">Distutils</span> (<code><a
href="http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig">http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig</a></code>),
which is included in <span class="name">Python</span> distributions
from version 2.0. To install the <span class="name">Anygui</span>
package in the default location, simply run the setup script with the
<code>install</code> command:</p>

<pre>foo:~$ python setup.py install</pre>

<p>This will install <span class="name">Anygui</span> in your standard
<span class="name">Python</span> directory structure. If you don't
have access to this directory (e.g. because <span
class="name">Python</span> was installed by a sysadmin, and you don't
have root access) you can install it somewhere else with the
<code>--prefix</code> option:</p>

<pre>foo:~$ python setup.py install --prefix=${HOME}/python</pre>

<h3>Doing it Manually</h3>

<p>Since <span class="name">Anygui</span> consists of only <span
class="name">Python</span> code, nothing needs to be compiled. And the
only thing needed to install <span class="name">Python</span> code is
to ensure that the packages and modules are found by your <span
class="name">Python</span> interpreter. This is as simple as including
the <code>lib</code> directory of the <span class="name">Anygui</span>
distribution in your <code>PYTHONPATH</code> environment variable. In
<code>bash</code> (<code><a
href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/bash/">http://www.gnu.org/manual/bash/</a></code>),
you could do something like this:</p>

<pre>foo:~$ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/anygui/lib</pre>

<p>To make this permanent, you should put it in your
<code>.bash_profile</code> file, or something equivalent. If you don't
want to mess around with this, and already have a standard directory
where you place your <span class="name">Python</span> modules, you can
simply copy (or move) the <code>anygui</code> package (found in
<code>anygui-0.2/lib</code>) there, or possibly place a symlink in
that directory to the <code>anygui</code> package.</p>

<h3>Making Sure You Have a Usable GUI Toolkit</h3>

<p>Once you have <span class="name">Anygui</span> installed, you'll
want to make sure you have a usable GUI toolkit. This is easy to
check: Simply start an interactive <span class="name">Python</span>
interpreter and try to execute the following:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; from anygui import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; backend()</pre>

<p>The <code>backend</code> function will return the name of the
backend in use. If it is neither <code>'curses'</code> nor
<code>'text'</code> you should be all set for making GUI programs with
<span class="name">Anygui</span>. (The <code>'curses'</code> and
<code>'text'</code> backends use plain text to emulate graphical
interfaces on platforms that don't have them.)  <span
class="name">Anygui</span> currently supports the following
packages:</p>

<pre class="verbatim">PythonWin  (mswgui)    <code><a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/win32">http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/win32</a></code>
Tkinter    (tkgui)     <code><a href="http://www.python.org/topics/tkinter">http://www.python.org/topics/tkinter</a></code>
wxPython   (wxgui)     <code><a href="http://www.wxpython.org">http://www.wxpython.org</a></code>
Java Swing (javagui)   <code><a href="http://www.jython.org">http://www.jython.org</a></code>
PyGTK      (gtkgui)    <code><a href="http://www.daa.com.au/~james/pygtk">http://www.daa.com.au/~james/pygtk</a></code>
Bethon     (beosgui)   <code><a href="http://www.bebits.com/app/1564">http://www.bebits.com/app/1564</a></code>
PyQt       (qtgui)     <code><a href="http://www.thekompany.com/projects/pykde">http://www.thekompany.com/projects/pykde</a></code>
Curses     (cursesgui) -- used when no GUI package is available
Plain text (textgui)   -- used if curses is not available</pre>

<p>Add <code>gui</code> to name returned by the <code>backend</code>
function to get the full name of the backend module (in the
<code>anygui.backends</code> package). For instance, the
<code>msw</code> backend is found in
<code>anygui.backends.mswgui</code> module.</p>

<p>In general, if you end up with a text-based solution,
<code>cursesgui</code> will be preferred over <code>textgui</code>if
your <span class="name">Python</span>-installation has a wrorking
<code>curses</code> module. The exception is if you are using <span
class="name">Anygui</span> in the interactive interpreter, in which
<code>textgui</code> will be preferred, to avoid interfering with the
terminal and locking up the interpreter prompt. (If you'd like to, for
some reason, you can override this behaviour with the environment
variable <code>ANYGUI_FORCE_CURSES</code>; see the API Reference
below.)</p>

<p class="note"> The BeOS backend (<code>beosgui</code>) is currently
not fully functional, but is included nonetheless.</p>

<p>Of these, <span class="name">Tkinter</span> is compiled in by
default in the <span class="name">MS Windows</span> distribution of
<span class="name">Python</span> (available from <code><a
href="http://www.python.org">http://www.python.org</a></code>), <span
class="name">PythonWin</span> (as well as <span
class="name">Tkinter</span>) is included in the <span
class="name">ActiveState</span> distribution, <span
class="name">ActivePython</span> (available from <code><a
href="http://www.activestate.com">http://www.activestate.com</a></code>),
and <span class="name">Java Swing</span> is automatically available in
<span class="name">Jython</span>, the <span class="name">Java</span>
implementation of <span class="name">Python</span>.</p>

<p class="note">In <span class="name">Mac OS</span> 9, <span
class="name">Anygui</span> (using <span class="name">Tkinter</span>)
works with with <span class="name">Python Classic</span> and recent
versions of <span class="name">Python Carbon</span>, but older
versions have problems with <span class="name">Tkinter</span>.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>

<p>If you want to contribute to the <span class="name">Anygui</span>
project, we could certainly use your help. First of all, you should
visit the <span class="name">Anygui</span> web site at <code><a
href="http://www.anygui.org">http://www.anygui.org</a></code>,
subscribe to the developer's mailing list
(<code>devel@anygui.org</code>) and the user's list
(<code>users@anygui.org</code>), and try to familiarise yourself with
how the package works behind the scenes. Then, you may either help
develop the currently supported GUI packages, or you may start writing
a backend of your own. Several potential backend targets may be found
at <code><a
href="http://starbase.neosoft.com/~claird/comp.lang.python/python_GUI.html">http://starbase.neosoft.com/~claird/comp.lang.python/python_GUI.html</a></code>.
